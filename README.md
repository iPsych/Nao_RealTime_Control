# Nao Real Time Control
Implementation of a basic User Interface to work with Nao Robot v4+ and ROS.

Virtual Reality (VR) is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment. Unlike traditional user interfaces, a VR system places the user inside an experience, giving him the possibility to intuitively interact with 3D environments. The concept of VR first emerged in the 1950s as science fiction, but it was another sixty years before it gained popularity and became widely accepted. Early VR systems were expensive and required specialized hardware but in the latest decade there has been a proliferation of consumer-grade VR systems at affordable price points. These systems are inexpensive, relatively portable, and can be integrated into existing robotic frameworks. This thesis describes a series of works, its components and architecture, developed in order to integrate NAO humanoid robot with a Unity-based virtual reality interface. The main goal of this integration is to develop an immersive, monitoring and commanding interface, easy to expand upon, that is able to improve the operatorâ€™s situational awareness without increasing its workload. The resulting interface developed for Oculus Rift is easy to use, with a rich catalog of features and leverages the powerful tools provided by the ROS Framework to achieve low latency communication while providing an abstraction layer to complex robotic hardware.
